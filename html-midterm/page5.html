    <p>- Was missing the DOCTYPE html so those were added at lines 1 and 2. </p>
    <p>- Line 82 was missing opening "p" tag so that was added</p>
    <p>-File was missing closing "html" tag so that was added on line 119</p>
    <p>- Line 81 has an "em" tag that was misspelled so I corrected that</p>
    <p>- Was missing the lang="en" aspect so that was added on line 2</p>

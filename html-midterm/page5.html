    <h1>Page 1:</h1>
    <p>- Was missing the DOCTYPE html so those were added at lines 1 and 2. </p>
    <p>- Line 82 was missing opening "p" tag so that was added</p>
    <p>-File was missing closing "html" tag so that was added on line 119</p>
    <p>- Line 81 has an "em" tag that was misspelled so I corrected that</p>
    <p>- Was missing the lang="en" aspect so that was added on line 2</p>
    <h2>Page 2</h2>
    <p>- Line 27 was missing a "b" element and had open tags</p>
    <p>-Line 26 did not have a proper closed "b" tag so I added the dash</p>
    <p>-Line 44 had the "b" tag outside the "h2" tag</p>
    <p>-Line 47 had spaces in the href</p>
    <h2>Page 3</h2>
    <p>-Line 53 was missing the letter "i" so that was added</p>
    <p>-Line 82 was missing the closing tag so that was added</p>
    <p>-Mulitple names and ages were misplaces which affected the table so those were put back in the correct place</p>
    <h2>Page 4</h2>
    <p>-Line 1 ewas empty so I added "DOCTYPE html</p>
    <p>-Line 38 was missing a "td" tag</p>
    <p>-All of the images were lacking "alt"</p>
